Extend Stay – System Behavior:

1. If the unit is available for the extended period, the booking is updated with the new total nights.

2. If there’s a conflict with another booking, the system throws:
  "Unit is not available for extension."

3. If the booking ID is invalid or not found, it throws:
   "Booking not found"

Notes:
Availability is checked via a SQL query that compares checkInDate and numberOfNights to identify overlapping bookings.
