# Backend Challenge - Java

This repository is a supplemental option for those who don't feel comfortable working with either our TypeScript or Python problems. It should be noted that the Python project was used as the source of truth for implementation details, and so this may not represent 100% idiomatic Java (sorry).

## Context

We would like you to help us with a small service that we have for handling bookings. A booking for us simply tells us which guest will be staying in which unit, and when they arrive and the number of nights that guest will be enjoying our amazing suites, comfortable beds, great snac.. apologies - I got distracted. Bookings are at the very core of our business and it's important that we get these right - we want to make sure that guests always get what they paid for, and also trying to ensure that our unit are continually booked and have as few empty nights where no-one stays as possible. A unit is simply a location that can be booked, think like a hotel room or even a house. For the exercise today, we would like you to help us solve an issue we've been having with our example service, as well as implement a new feature to improve the code base. While this is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills, we also want to be respectful of your time and suggest spending no more than 3 hours on this (of course you may also spend longer if you feel that is necessary)

### You should help us:
Identify and fix a bug that we've been having with bookings - there seems to be something going wrong with the booking process where a guest will arrive at a unit only to find that it's already booked and someone else is there!
There are many ways to solve this bug - there is no single correct answer that we are looking for.

### Implement a new feature:
Allowing guests to extend their stays if possible. It happens that <strike>sometimes</strike> all the time people love staying at our locations so much that they want to extend their stay and remain there a while longer. We'd like a new API that will let them do that

While we provide a choice of projects to work with (either `TS`, `Python`, or `Java`), we understand if you want to implement this in something you're more comfortable with. You are free to re-implement the parts that we have provided in another language, however this may take some time and we would encourage you not spend more time than you're comfortable with!

When implementing, make sure you follow known best practices around architecture, testability, and documentation.

To make sure that everything is setup properly, open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and you should see an OK message.
The logs should be looking like this

### Running tests

There is one failing test, which is the first task of the challenge.
This test should pass - without changing the expected return code of course ;) - once you have fixed the bug. 
If you need to change the format of the object, or the given interface, please ensure all tests still pass.

```shell
[~]$ ./gradlew clean test  

> Task :test FAILED
